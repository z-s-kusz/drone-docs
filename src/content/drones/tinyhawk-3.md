## Emax TinyHawk 3

My first drone!
I purchased it as a bundle with a radio, carrying case and (bad) goggles/removable-screen-combo to test out if flying drones would be much fun and I liked it a lot.

At one point I experiemneted with shaving wieght off of the canopy to the point that I broke the frame. I bought a new replacement frame (it still flies great post new body kit btw).

My biggest takeaway from this drone was that indoor flying is fun but analog video is so bad I'm not sure how this hobby survived purely analgo for so long.

I almost never fly it now, it is my only 1S that uses the old PH2.0 connection.
