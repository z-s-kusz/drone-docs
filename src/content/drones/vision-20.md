## Rotor Riot Vision 20

This drone is why I made this docs site!
I think this drone was only on sale for ~6 months before it was discontinued in favor of its little brother, the 1S Vision40. And rotor riot took the page away.

This was my 1st HD drone and I bought it as a bundle with a radio and my goggles.
I had to send it back as it had some ESC issues preventing it from flying.
The customer service was fine and the drone worked great when I got it back.

I find it to fly a little heavy and it's quite loud for something so small.
I saw an interview with the designer where he swore by 2 blade props for this build, but I bet I'd like it more with 3.
That's something I would test if I didn't know it would be a worse version of the Meteor 75 pro I have (it has the lighter camera system, 3 blades and is 1S with similar flight times).

I think I was getting about 5 minute flights when my batteries were new.

It's been a long time since I've flown this little guy, probobly have to update the walksnail firmware now.
