## Flywoo Firefly Nano Baby 20

My favorite drone of any size so far. Flies great outside (gets pushed around a touch by medium winds but never does the "neck snap" that micros experience). Is even able to fly in high winds. A bit twitchy to fly indoors but doable, especially with the 3 blade props.

I keep the prop guards on, I think the added wieght actually helps.

I wasn't thrilled with the locked, fast speed camera angle at 1st but it's growing on me.

I modified the 750 battery holder with tape to shrink it to fit my fat RDQ batteries that are too big for the 420 holder.

Best range of any micro I've flown, I think because it has a LHCP antena instead of the linear one that is on most walksnail 1S boards.

I prefer HQ prop T2x2x3 - 3 blade props - much quieter than the 2 blade it came with. I took these off of the gofilm20.
Similar Gemfan prop would be the Gemfan 2023-3 blade.
