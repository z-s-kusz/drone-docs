## BetaFPV Meteor 75 Pro

My best indoor flier. Advertised as 'the largest 1s digital whoop!'

It has great video range, flies fairly quietly (I'll give it 8.5/10 queit points) and handles very well.

The motors sag a bit at the end of the battery, even with vbat sag compensation on.

Flight times are well shorter than advertised (advertised as 5:30!),
averaging about 4:15 on my freshest batch of
the recomendded BetaFPV 550mAh batteries but plenty long for a micro 1s drone.
My older batteries get about 3:30 in flight time.


**!One Issue!**
Back left motor sometimes doesn't want to start. Drone seems to fly well once it does take off but I have to arm and disarm the drone a lot.
I think the motor and esc *do* work - when I connect it to betaflight it responds to all motot commands.

**Props:**

Came with Gemfan 45mm 3-blade props.
(I tried gemfans 2 blade props and didn't like it much - they were slightly louder and gave pretty much the same flight time)

**Batteries:**
Shipped with BetaFPV 550mAh BT2.0 batteries.
They seem great so I haven't tried any others.
Drone also shipped with a small charger than can handle 2 batteries at once, not sure where it is though...
